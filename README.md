# NorthStar Advantage Timeout

A verry rough, heavily system-dependent milli/micro second timer/sleep
procedure for the z80A 4Mhz CPU, using the Intel 8080 instruction set.

Designed to be assembled using CP/M ASM.COM, and run on the NorthStar
Advantage computer. The procedure assumes an Intel 8080 instruction
set and a 4MHz CPU, such as the z80A. Timer is based on CPU cycles.
