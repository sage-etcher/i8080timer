# i8080timer
A verry rough heavily system dependent millisecond timer/sleep procedure for the z80A 4Mhz CPU

Designed to be assembled using CP/M v2.2's ASM.COM, and run on the NorthStar Advantage computer. The procedure assumes an intel 8080 instruction set and a 4MHz CPU, such as the z80A. Timer is cycle based.
